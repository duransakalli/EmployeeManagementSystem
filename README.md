# EmployeeManagementSystem
I created a simple end-to-end full-stack web application that is basic Employee Management Application using React, Spring Boot.  

I built application in 2 steps:

    1 - sprintboot-backend (server) – To develop REST API
    2 - react-frontend (client) – Consume REST API

I built a full-stack web application that is basic Employee Management Application with CRUD features
